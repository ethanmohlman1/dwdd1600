        <p>The vast majority of media you will hear about in your life will fall under one of three categories; the <strong>good</strong>, the <strong>bad</strong>, and the <strong>so bad it's good</strong>. In the age of the internet, it's easier than ever to curate your experience with media, only selecting the most favorably reviewed shows, games, and movies to enjoy while disregarding the rest. But what about the millions of works that aren't good or bad enough to be noteworthy? This is the nebulous space where the mediocre live. The home of the unremarkable. An oversaturated, unexplored <em>purgatory</em>.</p>
            
            
        <p>Well, purgatory might be a bit of an exaggeration, but it's true that for every truly <em>noteworthy</em> piece of media, there's thousands upon thousands that have been overlooked. I'm not talking about cult classics, or hidden gems. Works in this purgatory don't sparkle. They're the rocks that surround the gem.</p>
        
        <h2>The Point of This Site</h2>
            <p>When we can access anything we want, it's not surprising that many of us will fill our media diet with things we know are guaranteed to please us. At a certain point in my life, I found myself agonizing over which tv show or video game to start next, researching meticulously for fear of wasting my time with something that wouldn't live up to my high expectations. This isn't necessarily the incorrect way to go about things, but I've come to realise this isn't the way I want to think about things. I feel that all to often that these <strong>hidden rocks</strong> are dismissed as not being worthy of our time or discussion. I believe that there is value to be gained from any piece of media, regardless of quality or popularity. In short, this site is an attempt to test my hypothesis.</p></p>
